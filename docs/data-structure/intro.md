# Explanation

That's the way that I found to share and save things that I considered important during my journey learning data
structure and algorithms.

I found this [roadmap](https://neetcode.io/roadmap) on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/maugzoide/status/1739446730179919952) and I think it's a very nice path to follow.

The idea is to do one exercise per day, show the code for ChatGPT and ask for advices of how I can improve the code
and make more idiomatic for Golang.
